Procedure for running the c program.

I have installed Putty and logged in with Blazer ID
Opened terminal and created a new file(insort.c) using command vi then inserted the program to check whether the given number is prime or not.
Compiled the saved file using gcc command.
Then executed using ./a.out command.
